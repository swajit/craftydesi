# Custom Mandir Platform 2

An evolution of our platform design, this version includes additional depth and subtle styling cues that make it a perfect standalone base for your home altar. Designed to elevate and protect your sacred space.

## Features
- **Enriched Profile:** Subtle beveling for a more refined look.
- **Reinforced Top:** Designed to safely hold heavier brass murtis.
- **Seamless Finish:** No visible screws or fasteners for a monolithic appearance.
- **Satin Wood Finish:** A smooth, tactile surface that is easy to keep clean.

## The Process
We used a "waterfall" edge technique on several prototypes before landing on this design, which balances modern manufacturing with traditional "V" grooving techniques.
