# Mandir Design 2

A sturdy and elegant mandir that brings warmth to any prayer room. This design focuses on a robust frame and clear visibility of the central deities, featuring a beautiful natural finish that ages gracefully.

## Features
- **Solid Construction:** Built for longevity and stability.
- **Wide Display Area:** Perfect for larger murtis or multiple photo frames.
- **Hand-Finished Detail:** Carefully sanded and oiled for a smooth touch.
- **Elevated Base:** Adds a sense of importance and presence to the unit.

## The Process
Starting with raw birch plywood, we focused on strong joinery and a flawless finish. The result is a piece that is as functional as it is beautiful.
