# Floating Deck & Pergola

Transforming a simple backyard into an outdoor oasis. This project features a low-profile floating deck paired with a custom-built pergola, creating a perfect space for relaxation and entertaining.

## Features
- **Floating Foundation:** Minimizes ground disruption and allows for airflow.
- **Architectural Pergola:** Provides dappled shade and a framework for lighting or plants.
- **Integrated Deck Lighting:** Creates a magical atmosphere after sunset.
- **Premium Outdoor Timber:** Selected for its durability and natural weathering properties.

## The Process
The challenge was leveling a large surface on uneven ground. We used a laser-leveled pier system to ensure a perfectly flat deck that feels like a natural extension of the indoor living space.
