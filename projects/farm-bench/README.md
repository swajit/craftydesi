# Handcrafted Farm Bench

A sturdy and inviting farm-style bench, built to withstand the elements while providing a warm welcome to any home or garden. This piece focuses on chunky proportions and a robust construction that highlights the raw beauty of the wood.

## Features
- **Overbuilt for Durability:** Heavy-duty legs and thick seating planks.
- **Ergonomic Design:** Specifically angled backrest for long-term comfort.
- **Weather-Resistant Finish:** Multiple coats of protective sealant.
- **Classic Farmhouse Aesthetic:** Complements both modern and traditional exteriors.

## The Process
We used traditional joinery techniques to ensure the bench remains stable through seasons of temperature and humidity changes. A study in functional, beautiful outdoor furniture.
