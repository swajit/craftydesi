# Heritage XL Mandir

Our most ambitious mandir project to date. This extra-large unit provides an expansive and grand space for a complete family altar. It combines extensive storage with a magnificent display area, finished to the highest standards.

## Features
- **Expansive Workspace:** Large enough for complex rituals and multiple murtis.
- **Integrated Storage Drawers:** Keep all puja samagri organized and accessible.
- **Hand-Selected Birch Planks:** Chosen for consistent grain across the large surface area.
- **Premium Hardware:** Heavy-duty slides and elegant knobs.

## The Process
Building at this scale required careful engineering of the structural frame to prevent sagging over time. The result is a rock-solid piece of heritage furniture.
