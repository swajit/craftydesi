# Classic Mandir Design 1

A sleek, traditional Mandir designed to accommodate deities/murtis at the lower level and various size frames at the top. This design is a perfect blend of functionality and spiritual elegance.

## Features
- **Adjustable Shelving:** Flexible top shelves to fit any size frame or artifact.
- **Sustainably Sourced Birch Plywood:** Hand-selected for its rich grain and even thickness.
- **Integrated Light Fixtures:** Bespoke lighting setup to keep the mandir elegantly lit.
- **Sleek Oil Finish:** Enhances the natural wood beauty with lasting protection.

## The Process
Every joint was meticulously planned and executed to ensure a seamless look. The focus was on "invisible" construction that lets the wood grain speak for itself.
