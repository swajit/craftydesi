# Multi-Tier Mandir (Design 4)

A sophisticated multi-level design that allows for an organized and hierarchical display of deities and sacred artifacts. The clean, staggered shelves create a sense of movement and architectural interest.

## Features
- **Tiered Layout:** Multiple levels for optimal visibility.
- **Spacious Deck:** Lower level for larger offerings and accessories.
- **Sleek Finish:** A modern, clean look that suits any decor.
- **Hidden Strength:** Internal reinforcement for heavy brass items.

## The Process
This project was a study in proportions. We spent significant time ensuring the height of each tier was perfect for standard murti sizes while maintaining a sleek overall profile.
