# Handcrafted Jhoola

An centerpiece of traditional Indian home decor, this handcrafted jhoola (swing) brings a sense of nostalgia and elegance to any space. It combines intricate design with the structural integrity required for a functional swing.

## Features
- **Intricate Detailing:** Hand-refined edges and decorative elements.
- **Robust Hanging System:** Engineered for safety and smooth movement.
- **Comfortable Seating:** Designed for long periods of relaxation.
- **Natural Birch Luster:** Complements its traditional form with a modern material.

## The Process
The key to a great jhoola is balance. We spent days fine-tuning the suspension points to ensure a perfectly level and smooth swinging motion.
