# Mandir Platform 1

A clean, elevated platform designed to transform any table or alcove into a sacred space. This minimalist approach focuses on quality materials and simple lines to create a respectful base for worship.

## Features
- **Elevated Design:** Raises the sacred space to a prominent height.
- **Solid Plywood Construction:** Built to support heavy items securely.
- **Natural Oil Finish:** Durable and easy to maintain.
- **Versatile Fit:** Can be used on its own or within a larger setup.

## The Process
Simplicity is the hardest thing to get right. We focused on perfect 45-degree miters and invisible joinery to create a solid, monolithic look.
