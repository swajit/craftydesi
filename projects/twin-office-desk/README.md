# Twin Office Desk

The ultimate productivity setup for two. This expansive desk provides dedicated workspaces for a shared home office without compromising on style or surface area. It's a study in clean lines and functional minimalism.

## Features
- **Dual Work Zones:** Ample space for two complete computer setups.
- **Integrated Cable Management:** Keeps the workspace clear of tangled wires.
- **Sleek Birch Surface:** A bright, inspiring material for creative work.
- **Minimalist Leg Design:** Provides maximum legroom and a light visual footprint.

## The Process
Achieving a perfectly flat 8-foot span required careful selection of the plywood core and a reinforced internal structure. It's as strong as it is sleek.
