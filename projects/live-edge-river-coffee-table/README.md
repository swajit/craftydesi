# Live Edge River Coffee Table

This stunning coffee table features a vibrant blue epoxy "river" flowing through two slabs of light maple wood. It's a conversation piece that brings a sense of dynamic natural beauty into your living room.

## Specifications
- **Light Maple Wood:** Offers a beautiful contrast to the deep blue epoxy.
- **Custom Epoxy River:** Each "river" is unique, with subtle ripples and depths.
- **Modern Industrial Legs:** Provides a sturdy and stylish base.
- **High-Gloss Finish:** Protects the piece and makes the colors pop.

## My Approach
Building a river table requires a delicate balance of wood selection and epoxy pouring techniques. I focus on creating a flow that feels natural and highlights the unique edges of the maple slabs.
