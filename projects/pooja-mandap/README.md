- **Spacious Deck:** Plenty of room for ritual items and lamps.
- **Natural Birch Texture:** The light wood provides a peaceful, airy atmosphere.
- **Solid Support:** Robust pillars ensuring lasting stability.

## The Process
We focused on the symmetry and balance of the structure, ensuring that the mandap feels both substantial and graceful.
