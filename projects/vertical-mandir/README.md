# Vertical Space-Saver Mandir

This project was born from the need to create a significant spiritual presence in a narrow footprint. By taking advantage of vertical space, we've created a multi-level experience that feels expansive without taking up valuable floor area.

## Features
- **Vertical Tiering:** Optimized for height, allowing for hierarchical deity placement.
- **Compact Base:** Fits easily into tight corners or between furniture.
- **Contrasting Stains:** Uses a beautiful interplay of dark and light finishes.
- **Illuminated Interiors:** LED strips hidden in each tier for a warm glow.

## The Process
The challenge with vertical units is stability. We used a weighted base and reinforced back panel to ensure the unit stays rock-solid while maintaining its slim profile.
