# Built-in Cabinets & Bookcase

A wall-to-wall storage solution that combines open shelving for books and decor with closed cabinetry for organization. This project was designed to maximize a living room's potential, creating a sophisticated and functional focal point.

## Features
- **Custom-Fitted Shelving:** Designed to fit perfectly from floor to ceiling.
- **Modern Minimalist Shaker Doors:** A clean, timeless look for the lower cabinets.
- **Adjustable Shelf Heights:** Versatile enough for any collection.
- **Integrated Cable Management:** Keeps electronics and lamps tidy.

## The Process
We utilized a scribe-to-wall technique to ensure a perfect fit against uneven plaster. The matching of the grains across the doors creates a high-end, bespoke feel.
